# FUJIFILM X-TRANS-III Recipes

I tried to implemented all X-TRANS-III recipes from  [Fuji X Weekly](https://fujixweekly.com/) to use it with FUJIFILM X RAW STUDIO. You can download the software and use it with your PC or MAC here: https://fujifilm-x.com/de-de/support/download/software/x-raw-studio/.

All credits to the recipes go to Ritchie Roesch who owns and maintains FUJI X Weekly the site. 

I implemented all the recipes from https://fujixweekly.com/fujifilm-x-trans-iii-recipes/ and here https://fujixweekly.com/2023/12/30/the-essential-7-film-simulation-recipes-to-program-into-your-fujifilm-camera-first-part-3-x-t3-x-t30/. 
There might be some errors, so use them at your own risk and do yourself a favour and double check the settings. 

To import the recipes to X RAW Studio simply download the files and copy it into this directory:

`
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\com.fujifilm.denji\X_RAW_STUDIO\X-T3\X-T3_0100
`

There should be a folder for your folder for your camera model and another one nested inside. Just copy it in there and then open X RAW Studio with your camera connected.
